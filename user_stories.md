As a Developer:

I want to design the webpage to let the user pic from 3 different items based on their preference and then keep track of what they chose. This is for the bus company to be able to test the products and see what is the most preferred.

I want to create a clean and clear display for the images so that the user can see them without trouble and make a decision.

I want to limit the number of choices to 25 so that the user doesn't get fatigued with their choices. After every choice I want 3 different images to be displayed.
